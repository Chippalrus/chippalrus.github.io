Speech based LipSync implementation for Unity.

Uses 4 blend shapes. Works with Microphone Input and AudioClips. Can work for 3D models. It isn't perfect or very precise, but for cartoon style characters this works pretty well.

Only 2D Example is provided, but same method and setup can work for 3D models.
